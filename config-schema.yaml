title: Config
description: >-
  The schemancer configuration file structure. This file is typically named
  schemancer.yaml and placed in the root of your project alongside your JSON
  Schema definitions. It controls how code is generated for each target
  language, including output paths, package names, language-specific options,
  and custom format type mappings. Each top-level key corresponds to a
  supported target language. Only languages with a configuration block will
  be included when running schemancer in multi-language mode (i.e. without
  explicit language and output arguments on the command line).

  typescript:
    description: >-
      TypeScript-specific generation options. When present with an output path
      set, schemancer will generate TypeScript type definitions. The generated
      code produces interfaces and type aliases suitable for use with any
      TypeScript project.

  typescript-zod:
    description: >-
      TypeScript Zod-specific generation options. When present with an output
      path set, schemancer will generate Zod v4 schema definitions with
      inferred TypeScript types. The generated code produces z.object() schemas
      with full runtime validation support, including constraints like min/max
      length, numeric bounds, and array limits.

      Java-specific generation options. When present with an output path set,
      schemancer will generate Java class files. Each top-level type is emitted
      as a separate .java file with Jackson annotations for JSON
      serialization/deserialization.

  GolangConfig:
    description: >-
      Configuration for Go code generation. Controls the output directory,
      package name, how optional fields are represented, and custom type
      mappings for JSON Schema format values.
    type: object
    properties:
      output:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The output directory path where generated Go files will be written.
          The directory will be created if it does not exist. The generated
          file will be named after the package (e.g. "models.go" for package
          "models"). This field is required for the language to be included
          in multi-language generation mode.
      package:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The Go package name for the generated source file. This appears in
          the "package" declaration at the top of the generated file. Defaults
          to "generated" if not specified. Can be overridden by the --package
          CLI flag.
      optional_style:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Controls how optional (non-required) fields are represented in the
          generated Go structs. Supported values are "pointer" (the default),
          which uses Go pointer types (e.g. *string, *int), and "opt", which
          uses the github.com/Southclaws/opt library's Optional[T] generic
          type. Can be overridden by the --optional-style CLI flag.
      format_mappings:
        description: >-
          Custom type mappings for JSON Schema "format" values. By default,
          schemancer maps common formats to standard Go types (e.g. "uuid"
          to github.com/google/uuid.UUID, "date-time" to time.Time). Use
          this to override defaults or add mappings for custom formats. The
          map key is the JSON Schema format string (e.g. "uuid", "date-time",
          "email") and the value describes the Go type and import path to use.
        type: object
        additionalProperties:
          $ref: "#/$defs/FormatMapping"

  TypeScriptConfig:
    description: >-
      Configuration for TypeScript code generation. Controls the output
      directory, output filename, optional field representation, branded
      primitive types, and custom format type mappings.
    type: object
    properties:
      output:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The output directory path where the generated TypeScript file will
          be written. The directory will be created if it does not exist.
          This field is required for the language to be included in
          multi-language generation mode.
      filename:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The filename for the generated TypeScript file. Defaults to
          "types.ts" if not specified. Use this to customize the output
          filename, for example "models.ts" or "schema.ts".
      null_optional:
        type: boolean
        description: >-
          When true, optional fields use "| null" instead of "?" (undefined)
          for their optional representation. For example, a non-required
          string field becomes "field: string | null" instead of
          "field?: string". This is useful for APIs that distinguish between
          missing fields and null values. Defaults to false. Can be
          overridden by the --null-optional CLI flag.
      branded_primitives:
        type: boolean
        description: >-
          When true, primitive type aliases are generated as branded types
          instead of plain type aliases. For example, instead of
          "type UserId = string", it generates a branded type that prevents
          accidental assignment between different string-based types. This
          provides stronger type safety at the cost of slightly more verbose
          usage. Defaults to false. Can be overridden by the --branded-primitives
          CLI flag.
      format_mappings:
        description: >-
          Custom type mappings for JSON Schema "format" values. By default,
          schemancer maps common formats to standard TypeScript types. Use
          this to override defaults or add mappings for custom formats. The
          map key is the JSON Schema format string and the value describes
          the TypeScript type and optional import path.

  TypeScriptZodConfig:
    description: >-
      Configuration for TypeScript Zod code generation. Controls the output
      directory and custom format type mappings. The generated code produces
      Zod v4 schemas with z.infer<> type exports and full constraint support.
    type: object
    properties:
      output:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The output directory path where the generated Zod schema file will
          be written. The directory will be created if it does not exist.
          This field is required for the language to be included in
          multi-language generation mode.
      format_mappings:
        description: >-
          Custom type mappings for JSON Schema "format" values. Use this to
          override the default Zod type mappings or add custom format handlers.
          The map key is the JSON Schema format string and the value describes
          the Zod type and optional import path.

  JavaConfig:
    description: >-
      Configuration for Java code generation. Controls the output directory,
      package name, accessor method generation, and custom format type
      mappings. Each top-level type is generated as a separate Java file
      with Jackson annotations.
    type: object
    properties:
      output:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The output directory path where generated Java files will be
          written. The directory will be created if it does not exist. Each
          top-level type produces a separate .java file. This field is
          required for the language to be included in multi-language
          generation mode.
      package:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The Java package name for the generated classes. This appears in
          the "package" declaration at the top of each generated file.
          Defaults to "generated" if not specified. Can be overridden by
          the --package CLI flag.
      accessors:
        type: boolean
        description: >-
          When true, generates getter and setter methods for all fields
          instead of using public fields. The fields become private and
          are accessed through getFieldName()/setFieldName() methods
          following standard JavaBean conventions. Defaults to false.
      format_mappings:
        description: >-
          Custom type mappings for JSON Schema "format" values. By default,
          schemancer maps common formats to standard Java types (e.g. "uuid"
          to java.util.UUID, "date-time" to java.time.OffsetDateTime). Use
          this to override defaults or add mappings for custom formats. The
          map key is the JSON Schema format string and the value describes
          the Java type and import path.

  PythonConfig:
    description: >-
      Configuration for Python code generation. Controls the output directory
      and custom format type mappings. The generated code uses Pydantic v2
      BaseModel classes with full type annotations.
    type: object
    properties:
      output:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The output directory path where the generated Python file will be
          written. The directory will be created if it does not exist.
          This field is required for the language to be included in
          multi-language generation mode.
      format_mappings:
        description: >-
          Custom type mappings for JSON Schema "format" values. By default,
          schemancer maps common formats to standard Python types (e.g.
          "uuid" to uuid.UUID, "date-time" to datetime.datetime). Use this
          to override defaults or add mappings for custom formats. The map
          key is the JSON Schema format string and the value describes the
          Python type and import path.
        type: object
        additionalProperties:
          $ref: "#/$defs/FormatMapping"

  FormatMapping:
    description: >-
      Describes how to map a JSON Schema "format" value to a concrete type
      in a target language. This allows customizing the type used for fields
      with a "format" keyword (e.g. "uuid", "date-time", "email", "uri")
      or defining mappings for custom application-specific formats.
    type: object
    required: [type, import]
    properties:
      type:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The fully qualified type name in the target language. For example,
          "uuid.UUID" in Go, "string" in TypeScript, "java.util.UUID" in
          Java, or "uuid.UUID" in Python. This is the type that will be
          used in the generated code for any field with the corresponding
          JSON Schema format.
      import:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The import or package path needed to use the specified type. This
          is added to the import block of the generated file. For example,
          "github.com/google/uuid" in Go, "java.util.UUID" in Java, or
          "uuid" in Python. Leave empty if the type is a builtin that
          requires no import.
